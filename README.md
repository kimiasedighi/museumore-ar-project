## Project Description <a name="project_description"></a>

Today, every field has been directly or indirectly affected by technology and it has improved the efficiency and accuracy of that work. One of these technologies is augmented reality, and this project is an attempt to use this technology in order to improve the method of informing people in the fields of artistic and historical works in places such as museums, galleries, etc. Although these days, similar programs have been used in great museums of the world, such as the Louvre Museum, it can almost be said that there is no similar program in Iran. Also, there is no published program that is not specific to a specific place and any person can enter the system dynamically and not only use the augmented reality features of the program, but also be the administrator of this system and add or delete information from it. For this reason, this project has been developed with the aim of creating a dynamic system for places such as museums, galleries and any other archives, which is a web application. This program includes special panels for the visitor and the administrator, each of them has its own features and facilities and has been developed for a specific purpose.

- ## Gallary / Museum Login <a name = "login"></a>

<p align="center">
  <img width="30%" src="https://github.com/niloufarmj/museumore-ar-project/blob/main/readme%20assets/Login.png"></img>
 </p>

  Objective:
  The objective of this login page is to provide a secure and easy way for gallary owners to access their account.

  Functionality:
  The Login page allows users to enter their username and password. The app will then verify the credentials and if they match an existing account the user will be taken to the dashboard. If there is no matching account, an error message will be displayed. The page also includes a link for users to reset their forgotten password.

  Layout:
  The login page consists of a return button to take the user back to the home page. It then has an input field for username and password. There is also a link to reset forgotten password. Finally, there is a button to submit the credentials and a link to sign up.

  Styling:
  The page uses a combination of HTML and React components for styling. The components include Text, Input, Button, Link, ReturnButton and CustomLoadingButton. The page uses a combination of colors and fonts to provide a modern, professional look.

  Testing:
  The login page will be tested for functionality and styling. The functionality will be tested by entering different combinations of username and password. The styling will be tested by ensuring that the page looks as intended on different devices.


- ## Dashboard <a name = "dashboard"></a>

<p align="center">
  <img width="30%" src="https://github.com/niloufarmj/museumore-ar-project/blob/main/readme%20assets/Dashboard.png"></img>
 </p>

  Objective: 
  The objective of the code is to create a dashboard page for the user with a profile image, the user's name, and options to add a new item, edit information, view the library, and logout.

  Functionality: 
  The code allows the user to view their profile image and name, which is retrieved from the local storage. The user is then presented with four different buttons with text provided by the i18n library for translations. The first button is for the user to add a new item, the second button is for the user to edit their information, the third button is for the user to view their library, and the fourth button is for the user to log out. 

  Layout: 
  The layout of the code consists of a ReturnButton component to allow the user to go back to a previous page, the profile image, the user's name, and the four buttons for the user to interact with. The profile image is displayed using the Image component and has a round shape, a width of 35%, a height of 125px, and is aligned to the left with 32%. The user's name is displayed using the Title component. The four buttons are displayed using the Button component and have text provided by the i18n library. 

  Style: 
  The code uses the Assets/CSS/button.css file to style the four buttons. 

  Testing: 
  The code should be tested to make sure the profile image and name are retrieved from the local storage, that the four buttons are displayed correctly and have the correct texts from the i18n library, and that the buttons link to the correct paths.


- ## Add New Item <a name = "add_item"></a>

<p align="center">
  <img width="30%" src="https://github.com/niloufarmj/museumore-ar-project/blob/main/readme%20assets/AddItem.png"></img>
 </p>

  This code is for a gallery page that allows users to add a new item, such as a painting, to the program. The page utilizes React, a popular JavaScript library for creating user interfaces, to create a form for the user to fill out.

  The page starts by importing the necessary components such as Button, Input, ReturnButton, AddFileButton, TextArea, AddImageButton, Text, Image, RemoveButton, VideoArea, and CustomLoadingButton. The page also imports the useNavigate hook from the react-router-dom library. The page then imports the useTranslation hook from the react-i18n library, allowing for translations of the page.

  The page then declares a function, AddItem, which contains states and a useEffect hook. The useEffect hook is used to fetch items from the API and set the items state.

  The page then creates a form for the user to fill out. This includes an option for them to upload an image, add a title, add a description, add an audio file, add an augmented video or image, add an extra video, and submit the form upon completion. The form also includes a ReturnButton component for the user to return to the dashboard page, an AddImageButton component for the user to upload an image, an AddFileButton component for the user to upload audio and video files, a TextArea component for the user to add a description, a VideoArea component for the user to view the extra video, and a CustomLoadingButton component for the user to indicate that their submission is being processed.

  Finally, the page includes a handleAddItem function for the user to submit their form. This function checks to make sure that the user has filled out the form correctly, and if so, sends a POST request to the API with the form data. If the request is successful, the page calls a compile function to compile the data. The page also includes an imageChange and videoChange functions to update the image and video states.

  With this design documentation, users can better understand the code and create a successful form for adding new items to the program.


- ## Library <a name = "library"></a>

<p align="center">
  <img width="30%" src="https://github.com/niloufarmj/museumore-ar-project/blob/main/readme%20assets/Library.png"></img>
 </p>

    Objective
  The Library page allows the gallery owner to view and manage the items they have added to the gallery.

  Requirements
  - The Library page must be part of a larger application, allowing the user to navigate to and from the page. 
  - The Library page must display the items the user has added in a visually appealing way.
  - The Library page must allow the user to view and manage the items they have added to the gallery.

  Features 
  - Return Button: This button will allow the user to navigate back to the Dashboard page.
  - Item Card: This card will show the user the item they have added to the gallery, such as the target image and title.
  - Item List: This list will display all the items the user has added to the gallery.

  Implementation
  The Library page will be implemented using React.js. The page will be composed of a ReturnButton component, an ItemCard component, and an ItemList component. The ReturnButton component will allow the user to navigate back to the Dashboard page. The ItemCard component will display the target image and title of the items the user has added to the gallery. The ItemList component will display all the items the user has added to the gallery. The page will fetch data from the API and use local storage to store the user information.
